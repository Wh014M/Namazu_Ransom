## Introduction

Namazu Ransom is a mini ransomware that i create with EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE. This ransomware encrypt all files into a folder with a symetric cipher, that means that do you use the same key to encrypt and decrypt data.

As it is for educational purposes I have placed both the crypt and the decryptor.

## How it work

Namazu Ransom use a aes cipher with 256 bits and cbc cryptography Since it uses Fernet and it uses the aes-256-cbc composition to encrypt data.
See more about Fernet [Here](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/).

To encrypt data do you need specify the key generate by the crypter.

If you want encrypt all personal files into a linux system, you only need chanhe the folder un the **rw.encrypt_files()** by a **/home**.

## Cryptor demostration

![Before encryption]()

This is a content of the file before encrypt, is a plaintext and the md5 for the same to check later.

![After encryption]()

This is the content of the file after execute the crypter.py, letâ€™s view the encrypted content and the md5 for the same after the == simbols.

## Decryptor demostration
![File in plaintext]()

This is the same file after execute the decrypt program. it go to the original status.
